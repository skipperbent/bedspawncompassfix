Minecraft MOD - Bed Spawn Compass Fix

Link: http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1824888-sp152-compass-points-to-bed-spawn-mod/

Are you one of us that think it's completely retarded that the compass doesn't point to your bed but instead lets you wander forever just to find you're original spawn point? Finally it's here! The chill pill we've all been waiting for... the minecraftforum.net moderators wet dream.... Let me present the "Compass Bed Spawn Fix" for Minecraft 1.5.2.

It points the vanilla compass to the last bed you've slept in. If you haven't slept in any bed, it points to the original spawn point.

It's made using the latest version of Forge (7.8.0.715) and it's only been tested on Minecraft 1.5.2. So if it fails to work or cause problems, then please check that everything is up to date.

This mod should not interfere or cause any problems with any of you're existing mods.
